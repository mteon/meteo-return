This is just the first release and it comes only with the IIFE template out of the box.\n\nA set of templates and commands for UMD on their way.  \nIf you think of another wrapper or capability that ExportJS should support, I'm all ears at [andri@dot.ee](mailto:andri@dot.ee) and [@theml](https://twitter.com/theml).\n\n\nUsing the ExportJS\n------------------\nInstall with:\n```\nnpm install --global export\n```\n\nRun it with `exportjs` and see the full help with `exportjs --help`.\n\n### Wrap a file in an IIFE (*iffy*)\n```\nexportjs iffy precious.js\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nExportJS is released under a *Lesser GNU Affero General Public License*, which in summary means:\n\n- You **can** use this program for **no cost**.\n- You **can** use this program for **both personal and commercial reasons**.\n- You **do not have to share your own program's code** which uses this program.\n- You **have to share modifications** (e.g bug-fixes) you've made to this program.\n\nFor more convoluted language, see the `LICENSE` file.\n\n\nAbout\n-----\n**[Andri Möll](http://themoll.com)** typed this and the code.  \n[Monday Calendar](http://mondayapp.com) supported the engineering work.\n\nIf you find ExportJS needs improving, please don't hesitate to type to me now at [andri@dot.ee](mailto:andri@dot.ee) or [create an issue online](https://github.com/moll/export/issues).\n",
